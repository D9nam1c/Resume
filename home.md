**Aspiring Software Engineer | C • C++ • Python • Java | Embedded Development**

## Introductory Blurb
Hello! I’m Volodymyr, a computer science student at Virginia Tech with hands-on experience in high-level programming, embedded systems, and Linux-based development. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it’s debugging a personalized binary executable in GDB, architecting a Raspberry Pi–powered home-automation project, or optimizing data structures for performance-critical applications.


## What I Do
- **Systems Programming & Debugging**  
  Have familiarity with both high-level and low-level programming languages.
  High level being C, C++, Java, and Python and low level being Assembly.
- **Embedded & Soldering Projects**
  Built a custom mini laboratory power supply with several voltage outputs.
  Built a custom alarm clock featuring weather and CO₂ sensors, inspired by DIY electronics tutorials.
  (See [Projects](prjs) section for more details)
- **Back-end Development**  
  Comfortable with C++, Python, and Java; experience developing and debugging multi-tier applications.  
- **Collaborative Development:** 
  Practicing version control (Git/GitHub) and code reviews in team assignments.  
- **Problem Solving:** 
  Applying data structures and algorithms from class to solve homework challenges and internship problems.
