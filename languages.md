## Languages I Know
I am proficient in English, Ukrainian, and Russian, having developed each language through distinct stages of my education and personal life. Ukrainian has been my native tongue since childhood, while Russian became a strong complement during my school years and regional interactions. English proficiency emerged through academic studies, international collaborations, and technical research, enabling me to engage confidently with global communities.

This multilingual ability enhances both written and verbal communication across diverse settings. In English, I prepare technical documentation and communicate with local colleagues. In Ukrainian and Russian, I facilitate effective teamwork with regional colleagues, mentor students, and contribute to local open-source initiatives. By selecting the appropriate language for each context, I ensure clarity, build rapport, and foster productive collaboration.
