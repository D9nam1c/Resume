# Internship – SCUTTLE Robotics  
**Firmware Integration Intern** | June 2025 – Present

At SCUTTLE Robotics, I’m collaborating with the controls and hardware teams to upgrade our robot’s onboard computer to the BeagleY-AI board and deploy its next-generation firmware. Key contributions include:

- **Board Bring-Up & Firmware Flashing**  
  Installed the BeagleY-AI board, developed custom Flash scripts, and validated initial boot sequences on our robot platform.
  **Driver Porting & Peripheral Integration**  
  Adapted and tuned low-level drivers for motor controllers, IMU, and LiDAR sensors to work seamlessly with the BeagleY-AI’s interfaces.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing**  
  Built test harnesses in C++ and Python to simulate real-world sensor inputs, verify control loops, and surface timing or communication issues early.  
- **Debugging & Performance Tuning**  
  Employed JTAG/SWD debugging tools and logic analyzers to trace firmware faults, optimize interrupt routines, and ensure reliable real-time performance.  
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration & Documentation**  
  Coordinated with electrical engineers on pin mappings, participated in agile stand-ups, and authored detailed integration guides and release notes for future firmware rollouts.  

This internship has deepened my expertise in embedded systems, real-time constraints, and multidisciplinary teamwork within a cutting-edge robotics environment.
